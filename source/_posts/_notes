To create a new post, copy `_copyMe.md` to `YourTitle.md`
Make sure to update the information at the top! (title, authors, tags, date, etc)


If using VSCode, open the _posts folder for (most) embedded images to work.
Also, if you are using VSCode, use the markdown preview. It's worth it.

Inline HTML (including style and script tags) works.

SPECTRE.CSS is included and can be used: https://picturepan2.github.io/spectre/ .

Please test on mobile, if possible. Use relative viewports/scaling whenever possible.

Files prefixed with "_" will be ignored.

# If the theme is updated, `hexo generate --force` must be run in `~/Artifacts/Blog/` on the server as the `git` user.
# I can do this for you, but please don't edit the styling without good reason as it will affect all posts/authors.

Keep posts decently professional.
